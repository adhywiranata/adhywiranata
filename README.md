### Hi! 🚀

My name's Adhy Wiranata - Software Engineer based in Jakarta, Indonesia with 5+ years of experience working on JavaScript, Go, Ruby, and PHP. I mostly dabbles on Front-End (JS, React, Vue), Back-End (NodeJS, Ruby, Go, PHP), Mobile App (React Native), and AWS (mostly working on serverless and containers).

- 🌱 As a Software engineer, I am driven to craft software products with impact.
- ⚙️ I love problems and passionate in solving them through pragmatic solutions.
- 🤓 I love any kind of space-themed things. Totally nerdy, huh? 

That's the gist of it. For more details about me, hop on to [my site](https://adhy.dev).
